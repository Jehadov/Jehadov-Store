# Jehadov-Store
Jehadov Store is designed to help customers easily find and browse various products, from groceries to household items.

Jehadov Store is a web project created using only HTML and CSS. The store features a comprehensive home page that includes a navigation bar with links to key sections: Home, Offer, Careers, Customer Service, and About. The home page's body showcases product category cards, such as Meats, Tools, Juices, Dairy Products, Vegetables & Fruits, and Cleaning Items.

Clicking on any of these categories takes the user to a page to explore specific products within that category. The Offer page highlights items currently on sale, while the Careers page provides a form for job applicants. The Customer Service page allows customers to report issues or seek assistance, and the About page offers information about the store.

This project marks my first experience in web development, focusing on creating a functional and visually appealing interface using only HTML and CSS.
